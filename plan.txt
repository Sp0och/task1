Task: 
Perform Regression with a small, high dimensional and incomplete dataset




Given: 
Data with over 800 features per instance (d > 800). Of these features around 200 are meaningful they said. 
Secondly there are missing values (NaN) and outliers in the dataset.




Approach Idea: 

- Outlier Rejection
Naive approach - calculate mean and std and remove all samples which are not in a std depending proximity of the mean



- Data Imputation: 
MICE

Alternative1: For each feature, plot a histogram of the datapoints and estimate a distribution. Fill the NaNs with sensible values from the respective distributions

Alternative2: KNN: is an option but comp. expensive and would have to project to lower dimension for it. also have to remove outliers before




- At this point standardize the dataset

- Irrelevant features: Perform pca and looking at the respective EVs keep those above a certain reasonable threshold (should result in around 200 relevant features)




- For the regression itself perhaps kernelized ridge regression or a NN?
